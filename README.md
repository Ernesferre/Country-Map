> This application will allow the user to search for information about a specific country and also view in real time where it is located on the world map.

> In terms of error handling, the proposed implementation makes the application intuitive, simple, and user-friendly. The implementation of the Select component helps prevent potential user data entry errors, as well as enabling and disabling the button when the data has already been entered
